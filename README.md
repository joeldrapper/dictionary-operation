# Cultured Code Challenge

I decided to complete the code challenge in [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org), a new language (still in beta) that I’ve become rather fond of recently. It lends itself well to this kind of thing and it’s a lot of fun to write.

Your text editor might not recognise Crystal, but setting the syntax highlighting to Ruby should work pretty well.

### Setup

```
bin/setup
```

### Run Specs
